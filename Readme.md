# Wificloner

## Description
Trafficanalyzer is an OpenWrt addon which includes a LuCi configuration interface extension. It uses privoxy to display the user a warning if she enters her login credentials on a webpage which does not transmit them encrypted.
After installation, you have to open the setup webpage of the addon, select the interface which should be configured to route http traffic over privoxy and run the setup script.
Warning: All http-traffic on the selected interface will be redirected over privoxy and privoxy will block LuCi. So you should use another Interface to access LuCi or use ssh for command line configuration. The setup does not redirect other ports or blocks forwarding to other interfaces. Please configure the firewall if you want to block all other traffic from or to the selected interface (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall).
